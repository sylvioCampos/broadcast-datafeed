# GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish packages to TestPyPI or PyPI.
# Refactored to:
# - ensure the pypa upload action gets the required credentials (password)
# - use consistent action versions (v1)
# - upload artifacts as dist/* so artifacts are pickable by download-artifact
# - make job permissions explicit for artifact download
#
# Triggers:
# - on release published -> publishes to PyPI using secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN
# - manual workflow_dispatch -> lets you choose testpypi or pypi (uses TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN or PYPI_API_TOKEN)
